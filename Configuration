Creating Ansible server and node in a Docker images.



Docker Installation On RedHat/CentoS Linux 
 1. Sudo su ( For root)
2. Yum update –y (For updating our distribution with latest required packages)
3. Yum install Docker –y
4. Docker –version(for version checking )

After Installation Of Docker 
	Creation Of docker Container with Help of Images.

Command For creation of 1st Container : Docker run –itd  --name ansible_master ubuntu  /bin/bash
Command For creation of 2nd Container : Docker run –itd  --name Target1 ubuntu  /bin/bash
Command For creation of 3rd Container : Docker run –itd  --name Target2  ubuntu  /bin/bash

 	Note : Here These two Containers with name Target1and Target2 will be the one on which we will be running are Ansible playbooks. 

 	Now Creating Our Ansible Server in One of the Container

•	The 1st Container ansible_master  will be our ansible server on which  we will creating playbooks.

Now Installing Ansible on Docker container

	Yum update –y
	Yum install vim python2 openssh-client ansible iputils-ping –y
[ Vim is a file editor , python2 is python dependencies, ansible is automation tool,iputils-ping is used for runnig ping command on distribution]
	Exit 

 	Now , Enter into Container Target1
	Docker exec –it target2 bash
	Yum Update –y
	Yum install vim python2 openssh-server iputils-ping –y
(Now For using ssh we have to enable it by doing “PermitRootlogin Yes” in file sshd__config)
	cd /etc/ssh
	vi sshd_config
•	Here in this file Uncomment the  Permitrootlogin prohibit password and then make its as  “PermitRootlogin yes”
	Passwd root
(Enter the password you  want for ssh connection )
	Service ssh restart
	Exit
Now In target 2 Container ,
	Docker exec –it Target2 bash
(Follow the same steps as in Container Target1)

Now in your linux machine after coming outside container 
1.	Command -> Docker inspect target1           (Here copy the private ip of container target 1 and save it some             where on your local machine )  
2.	Comamnd-> Docker inspect target2       (Same here copy and save)
    Now Enter into ansible_master container 
	Docker exec –it ansible_master bash
	cd /etc/ansible
	vi hosts
(Now in this file Copying the things I have written , here I will place the Ip’s of my target nodes in different group just in case , might in future I want to enter more hosts , Remember above I have copy the Ip’s by doing Docker inspect )
[demo]                                              #these are group names(demo and memo)
172.17.0.3                                                                               -> This can be different in your case
[memo]
172.17.0.4    

After Configuring  the Hosts file , Now Some ssh configuration
	/etc/ansible
	Ssh-keygen 
(here keep pressing enter till all the things done , this is a passphrase generation process for ssh connection)
	Ssh-copy-id root@(private_ip)      {Private ip of both target , repeatth command for 2nd Container}
Above Command is use so that while switching between containers we don’t have to give password again and again.
Now you can try ping each Containers to each other . You can also do ssh connection to both target nodes.
  For that : ssh root@(private_ip) , Now you will enter into target container.
 

	Here all the Configuration are Done We have Installed Docker on our machine and created three containers , from which one  container will act as ansible server and other two as ansible nodes.
Now we can create Ansible playbook run on target nodes .
